animals = ['bear', 'tiger', 'penguin', 'zebra']
bear = animals[0]



1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th 
This means 'Ordinal' numbers, because they indicate an ordering of things. 

0, 1, 2, 3, 4
This kind of number is a 'Cardinal' number and means you can pick at random, so there needs to be a 0 element. 


Remember: 
ordinal == ordered
cardinal == cards at random, 0
